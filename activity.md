- Initialized Phase 2 Ralph run: real data ingestion + 3-engine comparison.
- Forked MVP codebase into codex/, claude/, opencode/ subdirectories.
- Created plan.md, PRD.json, guardrails, and specs lookup.
- Engine choice: all 3 (Codex + Claude + OpenCode) building same feature independently.
- Comparison metric: output quality.
