# Guardrails

- WRITE CODE, NOT GOVERNANCE PAPERWORK. Every iteration must produce runnable code or tests. No-op "continuity checkpoint" iterations are BANNED.
- If you have nothing left to build, output <promise>COMPLETE</promise> immediately. Do not loop.
- Enforce TDD for implementation tasks.
- Preserve source provenance for every regulatory item.
- Prioritize direct official sources over secondary coverage.
- Never fabricate legal conclusions; mark uncertainty explicitly.
- Keep age-range targeting explicit (13-15 early teens / 16-18 late teens).
- Source reliability must be tracked and weighted (official > legal/industry > general news > social).
- Use MiniMax M2.5 via minimax-coding-plan provider for LLM-based analysis tasks.
- Keep architecture pluggable for future providers (Grok, etc.).
